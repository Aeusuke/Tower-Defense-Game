    The objective of the game is to defend your castle on the right for as long as possible. You win the game if you managed to survive 100 waves of enemies. You can adjust the difficulty of the game by adjusting the slider in the main menu. The three vital resources of the player are coin, power, and health. There are two types of towers: offensive and resource generator. The offensive towers help attack the enemies while the resource generators generate resources over time. Towers can only be placed on the green grass area. If the shop UI is blocking an area you want to place the tower, you can hide the shop UI by pressing H. Coins are only charged after you have successfully placed a tower on a tile. If you suddenly do not want to place the tower after clicking the buy button, right click to cancel the purchase.
    The coins are used to buy towers to defend your castle or to generate resources. The coin cost of each tower is shown just above the buy button.    
    All of your offensive towers rely on power to function. The towers will cosume power for every 5 attacks it makes and you can see how much power it uses and other stats of the tower by clicking on the image of the tower on the shop UI. If you run out of power, your offensive towers will stop attacking until enough power is available.
    Each time an enemy reaches your castle on the right, you lose some health. The game ends if your health reaches zero.
    To upgrade a tower, click on a tower you have already placed on the map and press the U button. The cost of the upgrade can be found in the tooltip on the bottom-right side of the screen after you selected the tower on a tile.
    To sell a tower, click on a tower you have already placed on the map and press the S button. The amount of coins you get from selling is also shown in the tooltips on the bottom-right side of the screen.
